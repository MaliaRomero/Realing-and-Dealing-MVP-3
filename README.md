# Realing and Dealing MVP 3

 
https://maliaromero.github.io/Realing-and-Dealing-MVP-3/

As a gambler, I want an animated event roulette wheel, so that the events feel more fun.

As a developer, I want three more events, so that I can follow along with the roulette tutorial better. (Bait and switch, jackpot, and spin again)

As a player, I would like the how to play screen to work in full screen and minimized screen, so that I can see all of the instructions.

As a competitive player, I would like to be able to discard all of my cards, so that I can be more strategic (Fixed eternal minnow bug)
